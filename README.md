Pokémon Machine Learning

## Description
This Pokémon ML Prediction project harnesses the power of machine learning to classify Pokémon based on their battle stats. Using a Decision Tree Classifier, it analyzes attributes like attack, defense, speed, and HP to predict a Pokémon’s type with accuracy. Built with Python and essential libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and IPython.display, the project provides an interactive and educational way to explore AI classification models. Designed for beginners and enthusiasts alike, it offers a hands-on approach to understanding how data-driven algorithms recognize patterns—turning raw statistics into meaningful predictions. Whether used for learning, experimentation, or expanding AI knowledge, this project blends fun and technical insight seamlessly.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites & Requirements
Dataset:
This version uses a new CSV file originally shared by JCardd on GitHub, updated with a Total column. It contains updated Pokémon statistics formatted for ML training. Be sure to check the repo for the latest version. Adapted to include the totals column.
Software
Visual Studio Code

### Installation
- Go to the GitHub repository.
- Click Download ZIP, then extract the files.
- Open VS Code, select File > Open Folder, and choose the extracted folder.
  
Open Visual Studio Code:

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Run the following command to install all dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn ipython

Step 2: Run the Pokémon Prediction Script
- Ensure your dataset (pokemon_ml.csv) is in the project folder or include the raw github path to the file
- Open the Python script (e.g., Pokemon_ML_Predict.py) in VS Code.
- Run the script
python Pokemon_ML_Predict.py

Step 3: View Results & Experiment
- Modify Pokémon stats and test different predictions.
- Visualize results using IPython.display for images.
- Explore improvements to the model by tweaking parameters.
